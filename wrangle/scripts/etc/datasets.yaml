  description: |
    This data file contains information about parked and working vehicles that were involved in FARS crashes. Prior to the Vehnit creation, the vehicles Not-In-Transport were not included in the FARS data. This data file had the same list of data elements and SAS structure as the Vehicle data file where the UNITTYPE of the vehicle is 2, 3, or 4. The vehicle data file will have the vehicles in-transport where the UNITYPE of the vehicle is 1. Beginning in 2010, FARS discontinued the Vehnit data file and introduced the Parkwork data file. There is one record per parked/working vehicle. This data file was replaced in 2010 with the Parkwork data file. See the Parkwork data file in the Data Element Definitions and Codes section for the element history of this data file.
